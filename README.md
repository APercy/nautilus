Minetest 5.2 mod: Nautilus

This is the "Nautilus", a grandchild mod from "Sailing Kit". It's water dynamics comes from Sailing Kit (by TheTermos). So it depends on mobkit. And It dependes on the biofuel mod for fuel making. With keyboard you can move the nautilus. When you press sneak, it dives, when you press jump, it emerges. And you can set anchor again by pressing E, but it only works when the Nautilus is near completely stopped (when the anchor is sucessfull, you receive a message on chat).

It can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the hatch with the dye.

Controls overview: (note: all click events must be done against the hatch, above your head)

    Right click: enter in/get off the submarine
    Left click (with biofuel): add fuel to submarine
    E: drops/get the anchor (but the submarine must be near stoped)
    Jump: go up/emerges
    Sneak: go down/dives
    Backward: go back
    Forward: go foward
    Left/right: Turn to left/right
    Forward and Backward together: shots light 20 blocks ahead (where the user is pointing)

-----------------------

Thanks to Sfence for the following collaborations: 
    Makes nautilus mod more configurable by settings (the limit for fuel, air, etc).
    Little reformated code (replaces some tabs by spaces).
    Add air support (defaultly available when vacuum mod is enabled)
    Refill submarine with air when cover is open on water surface
    Some air lost when the cover is open underwater.
    Add nautilus place check (cannot be placed on shallow water, have to be placed on the open water surface)
